# Welcome Survivors to Fallout 76 Glow Project!

With this mod I am trying to color all the objects in the game green, if you can see them better.
You can choose different forms of customization or you can even create your own custom file, the mod is also in unzipped form!
You can install the main Pack if you want or you can use the secudaries that are for different elements, you can also combine between them.
